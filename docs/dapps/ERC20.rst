Creating your own ERC20 Token on the MOAC blockchain
----------------------------------------------------

Before you read this page, you should:

-  Understand the following general concepts: blockchain, smart
   contracts, ERC20 tokens;
-  Be able to write a basic Ethereum smart contract in Solidity (see
   tutorial example);

After you read this page, you will be able to:

-  Write your own ERC20 token contract;
-  Compile and deploy it on the MOAC blockchain;
-  Use the ERC20 token;

编写 ERC20 通证的智能合约
------------------------------------

The `ERC20
standard <https://theethereum.wiki/w/index.php/ERC20_Token_Standard>`__
is developed by the Ethereum community.

::

    contract ERC20Token {
      string  public name;
      string  public symbol;
      uint    public decimals;
      uint256 public totalSupply;

      function balanceOf(address _owner) public constant returns (uint256 balance);
      function transfer(address _to, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success);
      function transferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success);
      function approve(address _spender, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success);
      function allowance(address _owner, address _spender) public constant returns (uint256 remaining);
      event Transfer(address indexed _from, address indexed _to, uint256 _value);
      event Approval(address indexed _owner, address indexed _spender, uint256 _value);
    }

User can develop its own ERC20 token. For that, we can either use a
ready open source library to help with the task, or write the needed
smart contracts directly from scratch. We will show both methods below
so you can master your ERC20 token development skills.

Using a ready open source library
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Let’s see how you can implement this interface by taking advantage of
the OpenZeppelin Solidity library, for instance. We will write a
TestCoin based on, for example, the PausableToken contract in
OpenZeppelin:

::

    pragma solidity ^0.4.18;

    import "zeppelin-solidity/contracts/token/PausableToken.sol";

    contract TestCoin is PausableToken {
      string public name = "Test";
      string public symbol = "TEST";
      uint public decimals = 6;
      uint public INITIAL_SUPPLY = 100000000 * (10 ** decimals);

      function TestCoin() public {
        totalSupply = INITIAL_SUPPLY;
        balances[msg.sender] = INITIAL_SUPPLY;
      }
    }

To understand better all the steps that the inheritance from
PausableToken has achieved in making our TestCoin a useful
ERC20-compliant token (and why it can be helpful to start from an open
source library like OpenZeppelin), you can follow closely the code of
each of the library’s files that were imported after each inheritance
and import is fully expanded.

For that, browsing the OpenZeppelin ERC20 token github repo will be very
helpful: our TestCoin is inheriting from PausableToken, which itself
inherits from StandardToken, which inherits from BasicToken and ERC20,
and so on all the way to ERC20Basic and the SafeMath library import.

Developing your smart contract directly
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Another way of doing this is to simply write the ERC20 interface and
your contract implementing it directly from scratch. As you’ll see, this
is actually a fairly straightforward task:

::

    pragma solidity ^0.4.16;

    contract ERC20Token {
      uint256 public totalSupply;

      function balanceOf(address _owner) public constant returns (uint256 balance);
      function transfer(address _to, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success);
      function transferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success);

      function approve(address _spender, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success);

      function allowance(address _owner, address _spender) public constant returns (uint256 remaining);

      event Transfer(address indexed _from, address indexed _to, uint256 _value);
      event Approval(address indexed _owner, address indexed _spender, uint256 _value);
    }

    contract TestToken is ERC20Token {

      string  public name = "Test Coin";
      string  public symbol = "TEST";
      uint8   public decimals = 6;
      uint256 public INITIAL_SUPPLY = 100000000 * (10 ** uint256(decimals));

      mapping (address => uint256) balances;
      mapping (address => mapping (address => uint256)) allowed;

      function TestToken() {
        totalSupply = INITIAL_SUPPLY;
        balances[msg.sender] = INITIAL_SUPPLY;
      }

      function transfer(address _to, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success) {
        require(balances[msg.sender] >= _value && balances[_to] + _value > balances[_to]);
        require(_to != 0x0);
        balances[msg.sender] -= _value;
        balances[_to] += _value;
        emit Transfer(msg.sender, _to, _value);
        return true;
      }

      function transferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success) {
        require(balances[_from] >= _value && allowed[_from][msg.sender] >= _value);
        balances[_to] += _value;
        balances[_from] -= _value;
        allowed[_from][msg.sender] -= _value;
        emit Transfer(_from, _to, _value);
        return true;
      }

      function balanceOf(address _owner) public constant returns (uint256 balance) {
        return balances[_owner];
      }

      function approve(address _spender, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success) {
        allowed[msg.sender][_spender] = _value;
        emit Approval(msg.sender, _spender, _value);
        return true;
      }

      function allowance(address _owner, address _spender) public constant returns (uint256 remaining) {
        return allowed[_owner][_spender];
      }
    }

Make sure to save your TestToken contract to a file on your computer
(e.g. TestToken.sol).

Compile and deploy ERC20 token smart contract
---------------------------------------------

As a next step, you’ll need to generate the bytecode and ABI for your
new smart contract. You can think of the bytecode as basically your
contract’s compiled code. The ABI (Application Binary Interface) is a
JavaScript Object that defines how to interact with your smart contract.

We will show three ways of achieving this as well - using `MOAC
wallet <http://wallet.moac.io/>`__, `Remix web IDE for Solidity
development <http://remix.ethereum.org/>`__, or compiling using the solc
compiler on your machine (i.e. the command line).

Using MOAC wallet
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

MOAC wallet is an online free, client-side interface for using MOAC
wallets, make transactions and deploy contract. It was developed based
on open-source software. To use the service, you need to run a local
MOAC node with addition command line arguments:

::

    --rpccorsdomain "http://wallet.moac.io"

 This will allow the access of MOAC node using MOAC wallet.

Otherwise you will see the following error message:

.. figure:: image/ERC20_moacwallet01.png
   :alt: ERC20\_moacwallet01.png

   ERC20\_moacwallet01.png

Example command to start a MOAC node connecting with mainnet:

``moac --rpccorsdomain "http://wallet.moac.io" --rpc --rpcport "8545" --rpcapi "chain3,mc,net,db"``

A successful interface connecting to mainnet looks like this:

.. figure:: image/ERC20_moacwallet02.png
   :alt: ERC20\_moacwallet02.png

   ERC20\_moacwallet02.png

To compile the contract, click the “CONTRACTS” icon:

.. figure:: image/ERC20_moacwallet03.png
   :alt: ERC20\_moacwallet03.png

   ERC20\_moacwallet03.png

Then enter the contract deploy page:

.. figure:: image/ERC20_moacwallet04.png
   :alt: ERC20\_moacwallet04.png

   ERC20\_moacwallet04.png

Copy the source code and paste in the “SOLIDITY CONTRACT SOURCE CODE”
section. After copying the source code, the compiling process will
automatically started. If no errors are not found, the right side should
show a “SELECT CONTRACT TO DEPLOY” menu.

.. figure:: image/ERC20_moacwallet05.png
   :alt: ERC20\_moacwallet05.png

   ERC20\_moacwallet05.png

Select the contract name “TokenERC20”:

.. figure:: image/ERC20_moacwallet06.png
   :alt: ERC20\_moacwallet06.png

   ERC20\_moacwallet06.png

Input the parameters values from the menu: \

.. figure:: image/ERC20_moacwallet07.png
   :alt: ERC20\_moacwallet07.png

   ERC20\_moacwallet07.png

You need to have enough balance to deploy the contract. You can choose the
amount of fee to use when deploying the contract. Click the DEPLOY
button:

.. figure:: image/ERC20_moacwallet08.png
   :alt: ERC20\_moacwallet08.png

   ERC20\_moacwallet08.png

This is the contract ready to send from Account 1. The Provide gas is
estimated by the compiler and we suggest you use it or put a larger
number. If gas is not enough, the contract cannot be created. To
continue, be sure to unlock the account to create the contract. You can
use a console attached to the MOAC to do this:

.. figure:: image/ERC20_moacwallet09.png
   :alt: ERC20\_moacwallet09.png

   ERC20\_moacwallet09.png

After deploying, the interface is returned to the main menu and you can
see the following transaction is creating.

.. figure:: image/ERC20_moacwallet10.png
   :alt: ERC20\_moacwallet10.png

   ERC20\_moacwallet10.png

After 12 confirmations, you can start using
the contract by click the admin page link.

MOAC wallet is good for beginners that only need basic contract
development needs. It cannot debug contracts. To advanced developers,
you can use Remix to work with contracts.

Remix
~~~~~

Remix is an online tool developed by Ethereum community to work with
smart contracts. MOAC also supports the deploy of smart contract through
Remix.

Open Remix on your browser, create a new file called ‘TestToken.sol’ and
copy paste the code of your smart contract. Make sure you are including
all the other Solidity files that your code is referencing with imports,
especially if you are using the open source library approach.

Select ‘TestToken’ in the Compile window then click “Start to Compile”
and the Details button next to TestToken. Upon scrolling in the popup
details window for TestToken, you should be able to see similar sections
to this Remix screenshot for the bytecode and ABI of your smart
contract:

If the contract is compiled successfully, remix will show the interface
like this:

.. figure:: image/ERC20_moacwallet12.png
   :alt: ERC20\_moacwallet12.png

   ERC20\_moacwallet12.png

To deploy the contract, you need to connect
REMIX to a local or remote MOAC node. In addition to other arguments, be
sure to enable the access of REMIX to the MOAC node with

::

    moac --rpccorsdomain "http://remix.ethereum.org" --rpc --rpcport "8545" --rpcapi "chain3,mc,net,db"

Click the Run Tab and you should see the following menu:

.. figure:: image/ERC20_moacwallet13.png
   :alt: ERC20\_moacwallet13.png

   ERC20\_moacwallet13.png

Choose the Environment menu: JavaScript VM is a simulated environment of
Remix, it can be use to debugging the contract without actually
deploying the contract to a real network. Injected Web3 is the default
web3 connecting to Ethereum network. To deploy MOAC contract, you need
to choose Web3 Provider.

.. figure:: image/ERC20_moacwallet14.png
   :alt: ERC20\_moacwallet14.png

   ERC20\_moacwallet14.png

After choose “Web3 Provider”, you can see a message like this:

Click “OK”,

.. figure:: image/ERC20_moacwallet15.png
   :alt: ERC20\_moacwallet15.png

   ERC20\_moacwallet15.png

You need to make sure the port is the same as the local running node.

.. figure:: image/ERC20_moacwallet16.png
   :alt: ERC20\_moacwallet12.png

   ERC20\_moacwallet12.png

You may see the error message like this:

.. figure:: image/ERC20_moacwallet17.png
   :alt: ERC20\_moacwallet17.png

   ERC20\_moacwallet17.png
  
If you see this error message, check the local
node that include both

::

    --rpccorsdomain "http://remix.ethereum.org"

and

::

    --rpcport "8545"

If the connection is established, you should see your accounts from the
Account List.

.. figure:: image/ERC20_moacwallet18.png
   :alt: ERC20\_moacwallet18.png

   ERC20\_moacwallet18.png

Before you deploy the contract, you need to unlock the account that send
the contract. You can do the unlock with the MOAC console:

.. figure:: image/ERC20_moacwallet09.png
   :alt: ERC20\_moacwallet09.png

   ERC20\_moacwallet09.png

After successfully deployed the contract, you should see the contract
address and other information showed in the menu:

.. figure:: image/ERC20_moacwallet19.png
   :alt: ERC20\_moacwallet19.png

Remix is good for developing and debugging smart contracts. It is not
very convenient to deploy multiple contracts. If your requires to deploy
multiple contracts, you can use the Node.Js packages.

Using the Node.Js packages
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You need to install solc package to compile the smart contract, and
chain3 package to deploy the contract.

To use the latest stable version of the Solidity compiler via Node.js
you can install it via npm:

.. code:: bash

    npm install solc

::

    var solc = require('solc')
    var input = 'contract x { function g() {} }'
    // Setting 1 as second paramateractivates the optimiser
    var output = solc.compile(input, 1)
    for (var contractName in output.contracts) {
            // code and ABI that are needed by web3
            console.log(contractName + ': ' + output.contracts[contractName].bytecode)
            console.log(contractName + '; ' + JSON.parse(output.contracts[contractName].interface))
    }

To deploy the contracts, you need to install the Chain3 package:

.. code:: bash

    npm install chain3

There is an example file in the package: example/contract\_deploy.js

After successfully deploy, you should see the contract is displayed 
Succeed!: 
0x95d703ea48477f48335ae9c477ce6d986bc68453dfe3d6582714045456b93405

Using solc compiler to generate the ABI and bytecode Another way of
generating these two files is to compile your smart contract using the
solc compiler on your machine. If you haven’t used solc yet, you can
follow these instructions for installing it on your machine.

Open a Terminal window and navigate to your working directory where you
have saved your TestToken.sol file. Run the following command to export
the ‘TestToken.abi’ and ‘TestToken.bin’ files to the bin directory:

::

    solc --bin --abi -o bin TestToken.sol

As the file extensions suggest, ‘TestToken.abi’ contains your contract's
ABI, and ‘TestToken.bin’ contains its bytecode.

If you prefer accessing the solc compiler from within a program’s code
to generate the ABI and bytecode files rather than using the command
line, you can use the following code instead:

::

    var fs =  require ( ' fs ' );
    var solc =  requires ( 'solc' );

    var cmds = process.argv;
    if(cmds != null && cmds.length > 2){
      var file = cmds[2];
      var name = cmds[3];
      var content = fs.readFileSync(file).toString();

      was input = {
        file: content
      };

      var output = solc.compile({sources: input}, 1);
      console.log('contracts', Object.keys(output.contracts));

      var ctt = output.contracts[name];
      if(ctt == null){
          return;
      }

      var bytecode = ctt.bytecode;
      var abi = JSON.parse(ctt.interface);

      console.log('bytecode', bytecode);
      console.log('abi', ctt.interface);
    }

Regardless of which method you followed, you should now have the ABI and
bytecode files for your TestToken smart contract. Next, you will be able
to deploy your token contract on the MOAC blockchain for others to
interact with it.
