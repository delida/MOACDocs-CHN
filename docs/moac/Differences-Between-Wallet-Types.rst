钱包的不同类型
================================


What are the different types of private key formats that I can use to
access my wallet?

The MOAC is stored on the blockchain, your MOAC private key or Keystore
File or whatever piece of information you have proves ownership of that
MOAC, which allows you to move it.

At the end of the day, you are always signing with your private key.

However, for additional functionality (like protecting it with a
password) there are formats & ways of storing your private key:

Keystore File (UTC / JSON)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  This is encrypted by the password you chose.
-  This is the recommended version to save.
-  This Keystore file matches the format used by Mist so you can easily
   import it in the future.
-  Make sure to have multiple backups.

Private Key (unencrypted)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  This is the unencrypted text version of your private key, meaning no
   password is necessary.
-  If someone were to find your unencrypted private key, they could
   access your wallet without a password.
-  For this reason, encrypted versions are typically recommended. To

   information.
-  However, you should print the paper wallet or save this in an offline
   environment (like a piece of paper or USB drive). This ensures a lost
   password does not result in lost MOAC, and acts as another backup.
