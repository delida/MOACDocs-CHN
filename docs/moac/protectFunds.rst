Protecting Yourself and Your Funds
----------------------------------

1.  Bookmark your crypto sites. Use those bookmarks and only those.
2.  Install the EAL Chrome Extension or the MetaMask Chrome Extension to
    warn you if you go to a crypto-phishing link.
3.  Use MoacWalletOnline Locally / Offline.
4.  Do not trust messages or addresses or URLs sent via private message.
    Always verify information w/ a secondary source. Don’t click any
    link regarding anything crypto, money, banking, or a service like
    Dropbox / Google Drive / Gmail in any email ever. And if the scammy
    clickbait was simply too irresistible for you, don’t enter any
    information on the page. Never enter your private keys, passwords,
    sensitive data on a website that you were sent via message
5.  Turn on 2FA for everything. Go do it. Right now. Quit your excuses.
    Choose Google Authenticator over Authy. Don't use your phone number.
    Then, make sure your phone number is NOT tied to your Google account
    (look in privacy settings). Turns out, you and your BFF Mr. Hacker
    can "recover" access to your account via that number, completely
    destroying the point of 2FA. PS: MyEtherWallet is client-side,
    meaning 2FA won't do anything in our case. 2FA is for ensuring the
    security of your password on a server. PSS: Don't forget to
    cold-storage your backup words for these 2FA things. It's a huge
    pain when your phone goes for a swim and your entire life is 2FA'd.

6.  For Token Sales: do not trust any address except the one posted on
    the official site. Bookmark the URL before the sale, get the address
    from the URL from your bookmark at time of purchase. Do not trust
    any other source (especially a random bot on Slack). PS: When are
    token sales going to start using ENS names?
7.  Double check the URL & Triple check Github URLs. Check it. Then,
    check it again right before entering any information. This is
    especially important for any sites that require usernames,
    passwords, email addresses, private keys, and any other personal
    information. SSL certs do not mean a site is trustworthy, just that
    they bought an SSL cert. Not sure about the correct URL? Cross
    reference Reddit, Twitter, Github, Slack and wherever else the
    project hangs out. Github URLs are much easier to fake and much
    easier to miss. Instead of downloading from that random URL on
    reddit, seek out the URL on your own. Following the developers of
    these repos on Twitter, friending them on reddit (lol...but
    seriously it's nice because their name will be orange), or starring
    said repos on Github helps.
8.  Always verify that the site you landed on is legit. Especially if
    you are about to enter your private key or download an application.
    What is legit? A service that people have used for a decent period
    of time with good results. If the URL has been registered in the
    last week or the site "just launched", err on the side of caution
    and avoid it for a while.
9.  Google the service name + "scam" or "reviews" Scam sites rarely last
    long. Value real comments by real people over a random blog. Value a
    collection of information over a single source. Understand that
    legit services will likely have a mix of positive and negative
    reviews over a long period of time. Scam sites typically have no one
    talking about them, everyone yelling about how they got robbed, or
    the most perfect reviews ever. The latter one is just as red of a
    flag as the first one.
10. Don't ever run remote-access software (e.g. TeamViewer) Don't
    ever...but especially not on a computer with keys on them. The
    number of security holes in these programs is atrocious. You 2FA
    your entire life, but then let a single string of characters give
    someone access to your entire computer & every account. ?
11. Don't use brain wallets Brain wallets are wallets where the key is
    derived from a word or phrase you choose. Human brains don't have
    the ability to create high-entropy seeds. Using a phrase that you
    make up, even if it seems "rare" or "random" is not as secure as
    using MoacWalleOnline's randomness and these phrases can be
    bruteforced by the millions. Read more. And more.
12. Install an adblocker that actually turns off Google/Bing Ads. I
    recommend going with uBlock Orgin. If you are already using Adblock
    Plus, it does not hide Google Ads from you. Go into your Adblock
    Plus settings and uncheck the box that says “Allow some
    non-intrusive advertising”.
13. Don’t click on advertisements. With or without an adblocker, you
    should never, ever click on advertisements.
14. If you have accidentally visited or typed a malicious site, clean
    out your recent history and autocomplete. This will prevent you from
    typing kra… and having it autocomplete to the malicious krakken.com.
15. No one is giving you free or discounted MOAC. Even for completing a
    survey. ;)
16. The guys who just finish their token sale don't want to sell you
    tokens via Slack DM. Neither does that smokin' hot 125px x 125px
    avatar.
17. Download the MoacWalletOnline Chrome Extension.
18. ONLY unlock your wallet when you want to send a transaction. Check
    your balance via https://explorer.moac.io/ for mainnet.
19. Lastly: use your brain Think for a moment. Don't assume, ask. Don't
    blindly follow, question. If something doesn't seem right...if you
    feel like the luckiest fucker on Earth...or if you find yourself
    asking, "I wonder why I haven't seen this on reddit yet", there is
    likely a reason.
