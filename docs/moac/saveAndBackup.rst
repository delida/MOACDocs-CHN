Safe Storage of Backups
-----------------------

It is recommended that you store backups of both forms of your key (the
Keystore / UTC file version and paper wallet version) in physically
separate, offline environments.

This prevents loss of the private key & password due to: dead hard
drive, lost USB drive, wet piece of paper, etc. Keep in mind that
physical loss can affect an entire area (e.g. fire, flood).

Nobody can recover your key MoacWalletOnline is not a web wallet and
cannot recover your private key or password, access your account, move
funds, recover funds, nor cancel/reverse transactions.

We are a client-side interface that allows you to interact with the MOAC
blockchain mainnet and testnet. Please secure & back up your key like
the millions of dollars it could some day be worth.
